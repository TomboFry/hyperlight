This post does not have a featured image, but does have a summary. You can see this by opening `example-post.md` in the posts directory, as there is nothing on line 3.

By default, this blog engine supports markdown as long as you've got the `parsedown.php` file in the root, so we can do fancy things like:

fn main() {

}
```

And last (but definitely not least), lists:

* Unordered
