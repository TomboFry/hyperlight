You Can Also Write in Plain Text
For those moments when you just want to write a quick note without formatting.

guide, plain-text, summary

This post is written using plain text. A single new-line does not constitute a
new paragraph, because you might want to write paragraphs with wrapped text,
like this one (checking the text file will make more sense!). However, using TWO
new-lines in a row will start a new paragraph.

Tada!

However, please keep in mind that you cannot using markdown headers, or any
other markup, including HTML! For that you will either need to enable markdown
and rename the file to `.md` - or rename the file to `.html` for pure HTML -
instead of `.txt`.
