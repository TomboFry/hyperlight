The Magic of HTML

<p>
  If you write posts in HTML, you're responsible for the entirety of the post's
  contents to be written using HTML. Paragraphs are not automatically converted.

  For most use cases, Markdown is preferred, because it'll convert paragraphs,
  create headers, format code, etc. <em>and</em> you can still write HTML
  in-between paragraphs. In Hyperlight markdown is not locked down like it is
  on GitHub.
